With the help of his intern, they have analyzed their content to identify important events and relationships between key players. The result is a knowledge graph describing the last two weeks on Oceanus. Clepper and his intern have spent a large amount of time generating this knowledge graph, and they would now like some assistance using it to answer the following questions.</span>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Clepper found that messages frequently came in at around the same time each day.</span>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop a graph-based visual analytics approach to identify any daily temporal patterns in communications.</li>\n<li>How do these patterns shift over the two weeks of observations?</li>\n<li>Focus on a specific entity and use this information to determine who has influence over them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Clepper has noticed that people often communicate with (or about) the same people or vessels, and that grouping them together may help with the investigation.</span>\n<ul>\n<li>Use visual analytics to help Clepper understand and explore the interactions and relationships between vessels and people in the knowledge graph.</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Are there groups that are more closely associated? If so, what are the topic areas that are predominant for each group?</span>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, these groupings could be related to: Environmentalism (known associates of Green Guardians), Sailor Shift, and fishing/leisure vessels.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">It was noted by Clepper\u2019s intern that some people and vessels are using pseudonyms to communicate.</span>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Expanding upon your prior visual analytics, determine who is using pseudonyms to communicate, and what these pseudonyms are.</span>\n<ul>\n<li>Some that Clepper has already identified include: \u201cBoss\u201d, and \u201cThe Lookout\u201d, but there appear to be many more.</li>\n<li>To complicate the matter, pseudonyms may be used by multiple people or vessels.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Describe how your visualizations make it easier for Clepper to identify common entities in the knowledge graph.</li>\n<li>How does your understanding of activities change given your understanding of pseudonyms?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Clepper suspects that Nadia Conti, who was formerly entangled in an illegal fishing scheme, may have continued illicit activity within Oceanus.</span>\n<ul>\n<li>Through visual analytics, provide evidence that Nadia is, or is not, doing something illegal.</li>\n<li>Summarize Nadia\u2019s actions visually. Are Clepper\u2019s suspicions justified?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol></span>"
